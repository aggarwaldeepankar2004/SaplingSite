"Sapling" is my first project using HTML and CSS. I made it to learn how these languages actually work. 
I chose to create Sapling, a website offering plant services like maintenance and vertical gardening inspired by my love for plants. 
This project really helped me understand HTML and CSS better.
Besides the technical stuff, I also added my own creative touch and styles, which helped me clear up many concepts along the way.
It was a valuable experience that deepened my understanding of web development.
